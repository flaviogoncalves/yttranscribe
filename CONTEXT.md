# Context

Glossary for `yttranscribe`. Terms only — no implementation detail.

## Podcast

A **YouTube video** treated as a long-form spoken-word episode. Despite the everyday meaning, in this project "podcast" never refers to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or a standalone RSS audio feed — those are permanently out of scope.

## Harvest

To obtain a transcript that **already exists**, by reading it out of the page. No audio is processed and nothing is inferred. Contrast with [[Transcribe]].

## Transcribe

To **create** a transcript that does not exist, by running speech-to-text over captured audio.

**This project never transcribes.** It only harvests. An episode with no captions is an [[Uncaptioned Episode]] and is refused. Despite the project name, no audio is ever processed.

## Uncaptioned Episode

An episode for which every [[Transcript Source]] declined — YouTube has no caption track to harvest. This is a **refusal, not a failure**: the tool says plainly that the episode has no captions and stops. It never falls back to speech-to-text, and never emits a partial or reconstructed transcript.

## Transcript Source

A named strategy for obtaining a transcript for one episode. Each source either yields a transcript or declines, so they can be tried in order. Every transcript records which source produced it, so poor output can be attributed to the source.
